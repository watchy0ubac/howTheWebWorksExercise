In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP?
Standardized protocol for how web pages receive or get data from a server

- What is a URL?
An address for a resource on the internet

- What is DNS?
The system that understands a URL and uses that to find the IP of the server it's trying to access 

- What is a query string?
A string that allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
POST - Attempts to send data to a web server with new information, not simply pulling the information, but can be used to update a page or post a forum post etc

- What is an HTTP request?
Attempting to access a URL from a client using standard HTTP methods, like asked a server for the site information

- What is an HTTP response?
The server returning the requested information from an HTTP request, like returning the HTML code so that a browser can display the page's content

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Headers provide additional info about a request of response. An example would be Accept-Language or Accept for a request. And some examples of a response would be Content-Type or Last-Modified

- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
The DNS converts the URL somesite.com to an IP address that it can find. 
The browser makes a get request to the IP including provided headers
The server receives the information and sends a response back to the client with an appropriate status code
The browser makes a DOM for the HTML received and looks for any other required resources like libraries, CSS, and Javascript
The browser sends more HTTP requests for the other required resources and will then receive a response for each of them

****Part Two: Practice Tools****

1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
$ curl https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate
What does a pirate pay for his corn? A buccaneer!
Why couldn't the kid see the pirate movie? Because it was rated arrr!
What did the pirate say on his 80th birthday? Aye Matey!
Why are pirates called pirates? Because they arrr!
Why do pirates not know the alphabet? They always get stuck at "C".

2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*
172.22.32.1

3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***. Visit the page in a browser.
Okay, I don't know how to put that into a text line, but I did that too. I prefer live server though, and use it for most projects already.
